# IPP_interpret-only_test_2023

VUT FIT - class IPP project 2 tests<br>
Should test mostly dynamic typing and obvious right and wrong functionalities of instructions.<br>
Some tests are generated and some are made by hand, so there is a room for error, if you find any, just create a
pull-request.<br>
Tests don't cover XML format errors, so if anyone has some great ones for that, i'd love to add them.<br>
