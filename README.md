# IPPcode23 Interpreter

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the IPPcode23 Interpreter project. The goal of this project was to create a set of scripts for interpreting the IPPcode23 language. The project consists of two main tasks:

1. `parse.php` - PHP 8.1 script for parsing IPPcode23
2. `interpret.py` - Python 3.10 script for interpreting IPPcode23

In addition to the scripts, detailed documentation for each script has been provided.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `parse.php`: This PHP script is responsible for parsing IPPcode23 instructions and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) for further processing.

- `interpret.py`: This Python script takes the AST generated by `parse.php` and executes the corresponding operations specified in the IPPcode23 instructions.

- `Documents/`: This directory contains documentation for both scripts. It includes detailed explanations of the code, design decisions, and any additional information about the implementation.

- `Tests/`: This directory contains test cases to ensure the correctness of the interpreter. It includes both input files with IPPcode23 instructions and expected output files.

## Getting Started

To use the IPPcode23 Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the `parser` directory to work with the PHP parser or the `interpret` directory for the Python interpreter.

3. Refer to the respective documentation in the `Documents/` directory for detailed instructions on using and understanding each script.

4. Use the provided test cases in the `Tests/` directory to validate the functionality of the interpreter.

## Project Requirements

- PHP 8.1 is required to run `parse.php`.
- Python 3.10 is required to run `interpret.py`.

Please make sure you have the necessary runtime environments set up before using the interpreter.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each script can be found in the `Documents/` directory:

- [parse.php documentation](parser/readme1.pdf)

- [interpret.py documentation](interpret/readme2.pdf)
